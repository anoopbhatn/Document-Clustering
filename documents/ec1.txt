Electronics engineering, or electronic engineering, is an electrical engineering discipline which utilizes non-linear and active electrical components (such as semiconductor devices, especially transistor, diode and integrated circuits) to build electronic circuits, devices, microprocessors, microcontrollers, amplifiers and other systems. The discipline typically also designs passive electrical components, usually based on printed circuit boards.There are circuits such as transistors, oscillators,amplifiers.
